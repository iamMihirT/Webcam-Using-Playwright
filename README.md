# Webcam-Using-Playwright

This repository is for automating the download of images from the Banff Public Webcam.
Webcam Link: https://www.banffjaspercollection.com/attractions/banff-gondola/webcam/

I am using Playwright to automate the process of downloading images on an hourly basis. Sample images downloaded are attached in the repository.
To start extracting images, simply run the Hourly_Canada_Webcam.py file. It will store images locally in the specified directory.
